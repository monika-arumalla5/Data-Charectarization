The subject website provides Airbnb listings and reviews data for the major cities in the world.

Overview of the data:
Data consists of the Airbnb listings from December 2019. I choose December 2019 to ensure to study the pre-covid behavior. 
Data consists of 16 columns which are:
1.	id – represents the id of the listing
2.	name – It is the name of the listing
3.	host_id – Host id is a unique Id associated to each host in Airbnb
4.	host_name – the host’s name
5.	neighbourhood_group – The city in which the listing is present
6.	neighbourhood – location of the listing
7.	latitude – latitude value of the listing
8.	longitude – longitude value of the listing
9.	room_type – Category of the type of listing like entire house, private room etc.
10.	price – cost per night
11.	minimum_nights – minimum number of nights that the listing should be booked for
12.	number_of_reviews – total reviews received by the listing
13.	last_review – Date when the property received its last review
14.	reviews_per_month – the ratio of reviews received, and the time property is listed
15.	calculated_host_listings_count – the count of listings a host has on Airbnb
16.	availability_365 – the number of days a listing is available in a year

Records count or the row count of the data is 61,540.
Size of the data: 28.7 MB

Proposed objectives of the project:

•	Explore and clean the data for any missing values and duplicate data.

•	Perform analysis on the price distribution in various major cities of California.

•	Check if the price has a relation with the minimum stays as well as property type along with location.

•	Perform geographical plotting of the price and location, and to see of if I can find any interesting aspects near the Silicon Valley and the tourist locations in LA.

•	 Analyze the behavior of hosts with multiple listings.

•	Understand the relation between reviews count and neighborhood.

•	Create appropriate visualizations and build a summary of findings from the data.
